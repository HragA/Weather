# Weather

This online weather application is built using React and using weather information from the MetaWeather API. The user will be prompted on entering a city name. Once, the user has entered a city name a list of cities will appear with the current weather of that location with an icon of the weather provided by Weather Icons. After, the user will be able to select any city from the list to receive a 6 day forcast of that location.

Please note that list of cities takes a couple of seconds to load as it's gathering all the information in the beginning to make transitioning between cities quicker to see the 6 day forcast.
